    "Differences\n",
    "Python lists are very flexible and can hold completely heterogeneous arbitrary data, but they use a lot more space than Python arrays. Each list contains pointers to a block of pointers, each of which in turn points to a full Python object. Again, the advantage of the list is flexibility: because each list element is a full structure containing both data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type. Arrays lack this flexibility but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between the two largely exist because of the aforementioned backend implementation. Arrays in Python are implemented just like C arrays, with a pointer pointing to the first element of the array with the rest existing contiguously in the memory."

    "Similarities\n",
    "Arrays and lists are very similar in syntactical usage and functionality. Both are used to store data. Both are mutable, i.e., the data in both is not constant and can be modified. Both can also be indexed and iterated through. Both can be sliced and are in fact sliced the same way."
